1. Have a selection of bots to choose to play against each other.
2. Set up a system of data collection for many types of data to be 
saved during gameplay that will be used later on. Some data ideas:
    Moves: including who and whether play, pass, or resign, and what point if play. freq of moves per player/bot
    Board: how the board looks every turn
    Point Advantage: difference in points/stones each turn #part of bot type that balances dificulty
    Bot specific data: explored later
3. left bot vs right bot comparison graph on how many games out of 100 or 1000. hypothesis testing on significance of one bot winning n times. 
4. other visualization and statistics
5. statistics on speed of computation and machine learning performance
6. alternate similar prohects include tic-tac-toe, dice roll on grid, and connect 5
